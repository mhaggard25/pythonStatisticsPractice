# pythonStatisticsPractice

This repository serves as a space to practice and explore statistics, statistical analysis, and related disciplines using Python. It will contain various files and small projects designed to help me learn and apply statistical concepts. My ultimate goal is to enhance my skills, become familiar with some of the most useful Python libraries and the Python language as a whole, and prepare for statistical analysis roles in sports teams and other companies.

I will be using various resources to aid in my learning experience. (I will add more as I come across them.)
1. The Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube.
2. Previous coursework from my statistics class from SNHU.
